Title: On Gaussian Process multiple-fold cross-validation

Abstract: In this talk I will give an overview of some recent results pertaining to the fast calculation of Gaussian Process multiple-fold cross-validation residuals and their covariances, as well as to kernel hyperparameter estimation via related approaches. At first, the focus will be put on results from (arXiv:2101.03108, joint work with Cedric Schärer), where fast Gaussian process leave-one-out formulae are
generalized to multiple-fold cross-validation. A special focus will be put on the impact of designing the folds on covariance hyperparameter fitting. In particular, I will present results of a joint work with Athénaïs Gautier and Cédric Travelletti on an inverse problem from geosciences where considered formulae and criteria are applied to linear forms in the underlying GP and the way of partitioning observations is found to substantially affect range estimation.
