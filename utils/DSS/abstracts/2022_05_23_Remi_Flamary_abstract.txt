Title: Modeling Graphs with Optimal Transport

Abstract:
Optimal Transport (OT) has recently emerged as a powerful and interpretable tool to model and measure similarity between graph
objects. In this talk we will introduce the Gromov-Wasserstein divergence and several extensions that have been proposed recently to
measure a similarity between weighted graphs. We will discuss two important aspects of OT on graphs: as a divergence between
non-registered graphs with potentially different number of nodes and as a transport finding optimal correspondences between those graph nodes. We will then present several applications of those divergences for dictionary learning of graphs, community clustering and graph completion.
