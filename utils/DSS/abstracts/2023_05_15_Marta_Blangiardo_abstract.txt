Title: Can we use spatio-temporal wastewater data to battle COVID-19?

Abstract: The utility of wastewater-based epidemiology as an early warning tool has been explored widely across the globe during the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, no attempt has previously been made to develop a model that predicts wastewater viral concentration at fine spatio-temporal resolutions covering an entire country, a necessary step towards using wastewater monitoring for the early detection of local outbreaks. In this talk I will first show how we can model the relationship between weekly viral concentration in wastewater at specific locations and a collection of covariates covering socio-demographics, land cover and virus-associated genomic characteristics. I will then discuss the potential for joint modelling of wastewater data and COVID-19 prevalence on a space-time resolved domain to improve the performance of public health surveillance systems.
